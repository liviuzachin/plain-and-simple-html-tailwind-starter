# Plain and simple HTML Tailwind CSS starter

This start was build for people not needing any framework.
It's sometimes enough to just have a plain HTML file, but leverage the power of Tailwind CSS.

The project uses the Tailwind CSS with all it's plugins, jit mode and purge to keep files small and clean.

## Installation

Make sure you have the `live-server` installed.

```bash
npm install -g live-server 
```

The installation is very easy, just run the install command.

```bash
npm install
```

Next up we can run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And you're website will start up.
